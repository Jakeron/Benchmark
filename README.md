Benchmark of Smart Meter Data Analytics
==============

We have selected the following five representative technologies for the benchmarking, which are

* **Matlab** -- A traditional analytics tool

* **MADlib** -- In-database (PostgreSQL) analytics library

* **System C** -- In-memory column store

* **Spark** -- Main memory based distributed computing framework

* **Hive** -- A distributed data warehouse system on Hadoop


*Matlab, MADlib*, and *System C* run on a centralized environment, e.g., on a single server, while *Spark* and *Hive* run in a distributed environment, e.g., multiple clustered servers.
